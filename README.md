# Welcome to NLP Book 

These are NLP experiments using AllenNLP. Here are some of the examples it include:

* Toxic multi-label classification
* Word2Vec implementation (Skipgram)
* Text Summarization using T5 and my own dynamic LSTM based model.
* Reversing number using Seq2Seq

Most of the code is available in **NLP** Folder. In future releases, I will attempt to make it available using pip package for anyone to try and experiment the code out. 

Happy NLPing!
